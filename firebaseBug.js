The Firebase Realtime Database sometimes throws a `FirebaseError: Quota exceeded` error even when your project appears to be well under its usage limits.  This can be due to several uncommon factors, such as:

1. **Data Structure Inefficiency:** If you have nested deeply-nested data structures or store large amounts of unnecessary data, it can lead to quota issues even if the total data size seems small.  Overly large data structures cause issues when the database needs to read or write significant portions of data in response to simple queries. 
2. **Excessive Write Operations:** This might be more hidden: A lot of small, frequent writes can deplete the quota, even if the individual writes are small. This is less obvious than large, infrequent write operations.
3. **Client-Side Data Synchronization Problems:** If you have inefficient client-side code that continuously updates or re-synchronizes data unnecessarily, that can lead to an influx of write operations that exceed the quota.  Improper handling of listeners, especially `onValue` listeners, can keep multiple listeners running simultaneously and cause this issue.
4. **Unexpected Indexing:** Without proper database indexing, querying your data could be much slower, which inadvertently leads to a higher rate of database read operations, eventually hitting the quota.   If you're relying on complex queries with nested relationships, make sure you have appropriate indices in place. 
5. **Unintentional Data Duplication:** If data is duplicated in multiple locations in the database (for example, you're making several copies for different purposes), it effectively increases the overall size, even if the original data is small.
6. **Third-Party Library Conflicts:** Some third-party libraries interacting with Firebase might not handle data efficiently, leading to an increased load.
7. **Incorrect Security Rules:**  Overly permissive security rules, even if they seem correct, can lead to an uncontrolled growth of your database, as unauthorized clients might create or modify data more easily, rapidly consuming your quota.
